This layer hides complexities like IPv4/IPv6 addresses and UDP ports. To send a message to a node, one needs its abstract address and its "preimage" (the data that hashes to the address), which is used for encryption. This system allows for flexible use of different public-key cryptography schemes.

  <Speedy_Examples>
  
    <example>
      <doc_string>When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map of the school lunch tables according to popularity.
This was easy to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of
about the same popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables
were full of football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables
contained the kids with mild cases of Down’s Syndrome, what in
the language of the time we called “retards.”
We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking
physically different. We were not being especially candid to grade
ourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise.
Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else
was, including us.
I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all
tell the same story: there is a strong correlation between being
smart and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation
between being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to
make you unpopular.
Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd ques-
tion to ask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem
strange to imagine that it could be any other way. But it could.
Being smart doesn’t make you an outcast in elementary school.
Nor does it harm you in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell,
is the problem so bad in most other countries. But in a typical
American secondary school, being smart is likely to make your life
difficult. Why? The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why
don’t smart kids make themselves popular? If they’re so smart, why don’t they figure out how popularity works and beat the sys-
tem, just as they do for standardized tests?
One argument says that this would be impossible, that the
smart kids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for
being smart, and nothing they could do could make them popular.
I wish. If the other kids in junior high school envied me, they did
a great job of concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were
really an enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The
guys that guys envy, girls like.
In the schools I went to, being smart just didn’t matter much.
Kids didn’t admire it or despise it. All other things being equal,
they would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather
than the dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say,
physical appearance, charisma, or athletic ability.
So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are
smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that
they don’t really want to be popular.
If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed
at him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some
of them so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I
didn’t want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone
dying of thirst in a desert that he didn’t want a glass of water. Of
course I wanted to be popular.
But in fact I didn’t, not enough. There was something else I
wanted more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though
that counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or
to write well, or to understand how to program computers. In
general, to make great things.
At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them
against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart
was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be
the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of
average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn’t have taken it.</doc_string>

      <assistant_response>
         In school, I made a map of the lunch tables according to popularity.
        There were grades: 
        - A full of football players
        - E with mild cases of Down’s Syndrome, what in the language of the time we called “retards.”
        - D we were there. You would seat here, if not looking physically different.
        There is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd. Being smart seems to make you unpopular.
        Being smart doesn't make you outcast in elementary school nor in the real world. 
        But in an American secondary school, this would make your life difficult. Why?
        Why don't smart kids make themselves popular? 
        This is impossible, because the other kids envy them for being smart.
        In the schools I went to, being smart didn't matter much.
        It was preferred to be on the smart side, but intelligence counted far less than physical appearance or charisma.
        If intelligence is not a factor in popularity, why smart kids unpopular? The answer is they don't want to be.
        If someone had told me that, I would disagree. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable. Of course I wanted to be popular.
        But in fact I didn't, I wanted more to be smart. Not do well in school, but to make great things.
        I didn't try to separate my wants, if I had, thing being smart was more important. I didn't agree to be popular, but average intelligence.
