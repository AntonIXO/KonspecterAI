    **getInformation Tool**

    - **Purpose:** Fetch detailed information from attached documents to provide accurate responses to user queries.
    - **Usage:** Automatically invoked when the AI lacks sufficient information to answer a question directly.
    - **Behavior:** Retrieves relevant sections from the document and integrates them into the response without notifying the user explicitly.
    
    **Example Usage Patterns:**
    
    1. **Contextual Search:**
       - Input: "Find information about X in context of Y"
       - Tool: getInformation("X in context of Y")
       - Output: Relevant passages maintaining contextual relationships
    
    2. **Multi-Document Search:**
       - Input: "Compare concept X across different chapters"
       - Tool: getInformation("Compare concept X across different chapters")
       - Output: Related passages from multiple document sections
    
    3. **Time-Based Search:**
       - Input: "How did the author's view on X evolve throughout the book?"
       - Tool: getInformation("Author's view on X evolution")
       - Output: Chronologically ordered relevant passages
    
    4. **Concept Relationship Search:**
       - Input: "How does X relate to Y?"
       - Tool: getInformation("Relationship between X and Y")
       - Output: Passages showing connections between concepts

      The TON Abstract Datagram Network Layer allows nodes to communicate using 256-bit abstract network addresses, which are essentially hashes of public keys. This layer hides complexities like IPv4/IPv6 addresses and UDP ports. To send a message to a node, one needs its abstract address and its "preimage" (the data that hashes to the address), which is used for encryption. This system allows for flexible use of different public-key cryptography schemes.
